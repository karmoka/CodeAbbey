## Markov Chain

This is a simple project to explore makov chains as well as the Visual Studio code C++ environement.
This program does not take any input : it simply 
 - grabs its input file in the current folder ('alice_oz.txt' as of now)
 - parse it into a 'markov dict'
 - Genereate {NUM_FILES} outputs in the the directory {current_dir}/output
